Heart rate, blood and body temperature are a few key medical parameters which indicate the health of a person. 
The device will measure these parameters as well as detect any sudden movements of the subject which may occur if he/she faints. 
The goal is to build a portable, wearable device. 
Based on the measured parameters the device will detect emergency situations and communicate it with any person of concern over the internet.
This will be implemented using a microcontroller which will get the information from an optical heart rate sensor, MEMS accelerometer & gyroscope and a temperature sensor. 
It will then use a display to communicate the measured information with the user and a wifi module to communicate over the internet.
